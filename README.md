Klovnstation 14 _(KS14)_ is a fork of [Space Station 14](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14).
[Our discord server.](https://discord.gg/rSjZ48VnMx)
We use the [Robust Toolbox engine](https://github.com/space-wizards/RobustToolbox).

<<<<<<< HEAD
If you want to host or create content for base SS14, go to the [Space Station 14 repository](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14), as it is holds all base code and resources for SS14 forks.
=======
Space Station 14 is a remake of SS13 that runs on [Robust Toolbox](https://github.com/space-wizards/RobustToolbox), our homegrown engine written in C#.

This is the primary repo for Space Station 14. To prevent people forking RobustToolbox, a "content" pack is loaded by the client and server. This content pack contains everything needed to play the game on one specific server.

If you want to host or create content for SS14, this is the repo you need. It contains both RobustToolbox and the content pack for development of new content packs.
